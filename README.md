# Lifelong Sentiment Classification

---

Lifelong machine learning or lifelong learning is a continual learning (also a continuous learning) process where the
learner learns a sequence (possibly never ending) of tasks; after each task is learned, its
knowledge is retained and later used to help new/future task learning. _A book on Lifelong Machine Learning, see [here](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/lifelong-machine-learning.html)_. Lifelong learning for sentiment classification is referred to as Lifelong Sentiment Classification. This repo hosts the codes or papers of lifelong sentiment classification.
